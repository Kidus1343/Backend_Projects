# NestJS Authentication & Bookmark API REST API ‚Äì Authentication, Prisma, and E2E Testing
### üîê User Authentication
- Users can **sign up** and **log in** securely using **JWT-based authentication**.
- Passwords are hashed using **argon2** for strong security.
- Authenticated users receive an access token to interact with protected endpoints.

### üîñ Bookmark Management
- Authenticated users can:
  - **Create** bookmarks by providing a title, description, and URL.
  - **Retrieve** all bookmarks or a single bookmark by ID.
  - **Update** existing bookmarks.
  - **Delete** bookmarks.
- Each bookmark is associated with a specific user, ensuring data privacy and access control.


This project is a robust RESTful API built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), demonstrating modern backend practices including modular architecture, authentication, PostgreSQL integration, and automated testing.

It covers the full development workflow‚Äîfrom setting up the project and creating modules to integrating a database with Prisma and securing endpoints using JWT and Passport.js. Passwords are hashed with Argon2, and validation is handled using NestJS pipes and DTOs.

The API features user authentication and bookmark management. PostgreSQL runs in Docker for easy development and isolation, while Prisma handles schema definitions, migrations, and querying. Environment variables are managed via the NestJS ConfigModule, ensuring clean separation of secrets and config values.

Custom decorators and guards are used to implement secure and reusable logic for extracting user data from JWTs. End-to-end tests are written using [PactumJS](https://pactumjs.github.io/), with isolated test environments and automated database setup/teardown logic.
